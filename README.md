# Pharma Sales ETL Pipeline

## A hands‑on data engineering project using real‑world pharma sales logic

This project demonstrates my end‑to‑end ETL skills by designing and implementing a small data warehouse using a pharmaceutical sales dataset. The goal is to extract raw data, clean and standardize it in a staging layer, and load it into a dimensional model optimized for analytics.

## The dataset simulates a common real‑world pharma scenario:
Pharmaceutical companies sell products through distributors, who then supply hospitals, pharmacies, and other healthcare institutions. A third‑party analytics provider collects this information for reporting and performance tracking.

This ETL pipeline transforms that raw operational data into a clean, analysis‑ready star schema.
